/*
At times, it may happen that within a thread's routine, a mutex is waiting for another to be unlocked beforehand, while another
thread requires the opposite process to happen. For instance, if:
    路Thread 1 requires to lock mutexes 1 and 2 (in the specified order),
    路Thread 2 requires to lock mutexes 2 and 1 (in the specified order),
a situation known as "Deadlock" may occur. When using common mutexes, the program will get stuck since each thread is waiting for
the other to release locked resources to go on with their tasks.

There are many strategies to prevent these deadlocks, being timed mutexes some of the most common ones. This kind of mutexes are
pretty similar to a common mutex, but waiting for a specified time span to be elapsed before a thread quits trying to lock the target
mutex.

Note that timed mutexes are not kind of a deadline which sets the time at which the mutex will be released by default, but a
point in time from which a thread will not try anymore to lock it if it has not been already released. Thus, it can be regarded as
kind of a "timed trylock".

This way, if the situation previously described happens, and "1" mutex is timed and locked by thread B, it will be unlocked sooner
or later (as it has a deadline for that to happen) and it will eventually let thread A continue its own path.

Timed mutexes are not a whole different type of variable, but common mutexes that have been locked in a special way instead. To do so,
syntax below must be followed:

pthread_mutex_timedlock(pthread_mutex_t* mutex, struct timespec* time)

Where:
    路mutex: is the mutex variable type for which a timeout is to be set.
    路time: timeout for the target mutex to be released if it has not been already done explicitly.
    Returns 0 for success, or an error code otherwise.

Note that such function may not be available in every environment. If so, try to compile with -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=700 flag.
