/*
Barriers are a sycnhronization element that allow setting a checkpoint for different threads, without using pthread_join in the main thread.
This way, several threads may execute a task and wait for the barrier to be opened. Once the barrier is opened, they can continue their execution.

The syntax for barriers is the following:

For initialization:
pthread_barrier_init(pthread_barrier_t *barrier, const pthread_barrierattr_t *attr, unsigned int count)

Where:
路barrier: a pointer to a barrier. Similar to a mutex, it's a point in the code that locks the execution of the thread, in this case, until the
gets freed.
路barrierattr_t: barrier attributes.
路count: number of threads meant to reach the barrier. Once all of them have met the barrier point, the barrier gets opened and every thread
may continue its execution. This should be used with care, as the number of threads to be using the barrier condition must match the counter's
value. Otherwise, it may lead to race conditions (if count is lower) or deadlocks (if counter is higher).

For destruction:
pthread_barrier_destroy(pthread_barrier_t *barrier)

Where:
路barrier: a pointer to the barrier object that's no longer meant to be used (quite similar to mutex destruction).
